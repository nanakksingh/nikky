There are some changes which needs to be made according to the server to which it is deployed.

1. If the project is deployed to free service offering servers like pythonanywhere, then just use oldsettings.py in dock directory.
2. Some changes needs to be made in settings.py file and hosts.py file in above scenario.
Otherwise if the project is deployed in Heroku or AWS then no change required.
